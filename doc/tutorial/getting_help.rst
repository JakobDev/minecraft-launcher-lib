Getting Help
==========================
Here are some sources if you need more information.

- This documentation contains under modules a list of modules with every function you can use. You should check it out. You can test the functions in a interactive Python Shell.
- Check out the :repolink:`Examples on Codeberg <examples>`.
- You can check out the source of the programs in the :doc:`/showcase`.
- If none of them above help, feel free to `open a Issue <https://codeberg.org/JakobDev/minecraft-launcher-lib/issues>`_.
